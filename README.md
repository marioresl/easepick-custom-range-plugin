# Easepick Custom Range Plugin

This custom plugin for Easepick extends the functionality of the Range Plugin by allowing users to set an "endless" end date. Internally, the plugin represents this endless date as January 1, 3000. You can handel this "magic number" in your backend to allow to set a range to an infinite date.

Most of the code is from the @easepick/range-plugin.
